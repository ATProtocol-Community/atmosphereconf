Yes, you can read the [initial announcement on Remote / Hybrid participation](https://news.atmosphereconf.org/3mdm4s4psws2a).

Go to the [Remote](/remote) page for the main dashboard for remote streaming & chat, plus forums and more. There is a $10USD suggested donation for remote attendees, and regardless of payment we ask that you register and accept the code of conduct.

## Will the workshops be available virtually or are there any virtual workshops?

Great question. The workshops will primarily be designed as in person workshops, with presentations and support.

We’ll look at capturing video / streaming the ones that make sense, and as we confirm workshops we’ll discuss with presenters how / if they are able to also include remote participants.
