  question: Are there options for attending the conference remotely?
  answer: |
    Yes, you can read the [initial announcement on Remote / Hybrid participation](https://news.atmosphereconf.org/3mdm4s4psws2a).

    Go to the [Remote](/remote) page for the main dashboard for remote streaming & chat, plus forums and more. There is a $10USD suggested donation for remote attendees, and regardless of payment we ask that you register and accept the code of conduct.

  question: Will the workshops be available virtually or are there any virtual workshops?
  answer: |
    The workshops will primarily be designed as in person workshops, with presentations and support.

    We'll look at capturing video / streaming the ones that make sense, and as we confirm workshops we'll discuss with presenters how / if they are able to also include remote participants.
